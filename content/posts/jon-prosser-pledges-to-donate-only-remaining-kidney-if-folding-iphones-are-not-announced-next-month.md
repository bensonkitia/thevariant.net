**Update:** Prosser has clarified the tone of his Tweet, stating in a reply that he's "Dead serious."

Jon Prosser, a prominent Apple analyst and leaker, shocked many yesterday with [a Tweet](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1323914087340781569) pledging to “give away [his] remaining kidney” if Apple doesn’t announce a “folding iPhone by the end of November”.

While it has been widely speculated that Apple has its eye on folding phone technology, no other sources have suggested any time frame for the unveiling of a folding iPhone. Mark Gurman, among several other analysts, has expressed doubt towards Prosser’s prediction. [Gurman Tweeted](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1306032930414755840) that "It’s more likely [he’d] sign an exclusive deal with fucking Bloomberg than Apple drop a folding iPhone next month".
